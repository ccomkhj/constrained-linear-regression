# Multi-Constrained Regression and Neural Network Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to hosting and sharing advanced techniques in machine learning algorithms, particularly focusing on constraining the weights of certain inputs in regression and multi-layer perceptron. Inspired by the robust scikit-learn library, we have ventured into reverse engineering and extending its capabilities to fit custom requirements for specific types of learning problems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for machine learning practitioners looking to impose constraints on the input features' weights, which could be critical in certain domains such as finance, healthcare, and operational research. The reverse-engineered solutions herein allow for greater control over the machine learning model's behavior, ensuring that the influence of some features remains within desired boundaries.

## Tutorials

We provide detailed tutorials for the following topics:

- **Multi-Constrained Linear Regression**: This tutorial takes you through the steps of creating a linear regression model that allows constraints to be placed on the weights of multiple input features.
  - [Multi-Constrained Linear Regression Tutorial](tutorial/MultiConstrainedLinearRegression.md)

- **Multi-Constrained Multi-Layer Perceptron**: Explore the implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (neural network) that incorporates constraints on the weights corresponding to specific input features.
  - [Multi-Constrained Multi-Layer Perceptron Tutorial](tutorial/MultiConstrainedMultiLayerPerceptron.md)

## Features

- Reverse engineering techniques applied to scikit-learn's Linear Regression and MLP models
- Custom weight constraint functionalities
- Step-by-step tutorials for implementing the above models
