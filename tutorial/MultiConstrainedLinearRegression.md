# constrained-linear-regression with Darts

This package also provides out-of-box compatibility with [Unit8's Darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/), a forecasting library. Darts supports a rich variety of models including but not limited to ARIMA, Prophet, Theta, and a host of others. 

One of the major features of `MultiConstrainedLinearRegression` when used with Darts, is the ability to set different constraints for coefficients for each custom horizon.

The `MultiConstrainedLinearRegression` class comes with the optional functionality of handling constraints through penalties, an approach not unlike the Ridge regularization, but with the added awareness of the pre-specified boundaries in the form of minimum and maximum constraints. 


Here's an example using dummy data:

```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from constrainedML.multi_constrained_linear_regression import MultiConstrainedLinearRegression
from darts.models import RegressionModel
from darts.timeseries import TimeSeries
from darts.dataprocessing.transformers import Scaler

# Create two pandas dataframes df_feature and df_target
date_rng = pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', end='3/31/2021', freq='D')
df_feature = pd.DataFrame(date_rng, columns=['ds'])
df_feature['feature1'] = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))
df_feature['feature2'] = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))
df_feature['feature3'] = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))
df_feature['feature4'] = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))

df_target = pd.DataFrame(date_rng, columns=['ds'])
df_target['y'] = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))

# Load dataframes into time series
series_feature = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df_feature, time_col='ds')
series_target = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df_target, time_col='ds')

lag_feature = {
    "feature1": [-1,-2,-3],
    "feature2": [-1,-2],
    "feature3": 1,
    "feature4": 1
}

def get_total_lags(lag_feature):
    total_lags = 1   # Initialized to 1 for the original target
    for key, value in lag_feature.items():
        if isinstance(value, list):
            total_lags += len(value)   # For lists, add the number of lags specified
        else:
            total_lags += 1   # For integers or other types, consider it as a single lag
    return total_lags

total_lags = get_total_lags(lag_feature) # numer of features
horizon = 14 # forecast horizon days

custom_model = MultiConstrainedLinearRegression(fit_intercept=False, nonnegative=True)

model = RegressionModel(lags=1, output_chunk_length=horizon, lags_past_covariates=lag_feature, model=custom_model, multi_models=True,
                       add_encoders={'transformer': Scaler()})

```
```Python
# Here we set different minimum and maximum constraints for coefficients for each horizon.
min_coef = np.zeros((horizon, total_lags))
max_coef = np.ones((horizon, total_lags))*np.inf

# Custom constraints
max_coef[:,0] = 0 # don't use target
max_coef[1:,6] = 0 
max_coef[2:,1] = 0 
max_coef[:,6] = 0 # ignore the last
```
```Python
model.fit(series_target, past_covariates=series_feature, min_coef=min_coef, max_coef=max_coef)
model.model.estimator.reset() # Reset global variable between multi_models

# Predict the next 14 days, using the past 14 days.
pred = model.predict(n=horizon, past_covariates=series_feature)

# Output the learned coefficients and intercepts
for i, estimator in enumerate(model.model.estimators_):
    print(f"The coefficients for day {i+1} are {estimator.coef_}")
    print(f"The intercept for day {i+1} is {estimator.intercept_}")
```
In this example, the `MultiConstrainedLinearRegression` model is used with Darts' `RegressionModel` for sequence forecasts. We apply different constraints for each day within the forecast horizon, controlled by the `min_coef` and `max_coef` parameters. 

This gives us the flexibility to independently control the linearity of the regression model for different periods within the forecast horizon.
